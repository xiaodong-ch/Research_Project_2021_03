The code script from the Research project: "Interaction between microbiome composition in early-life infant gut with health-related variables"
### To remind myself
1. Try to name each file clearly indicating the content.
2. Upload everthing as soon as possible.
3. DO NOT afraid of code performance. It should not be perfect but useful.
4. Take notes at the same time.
5. Keep updating README
### Rules for files
1. Try to use folders for raw and mediate files
2. One task one folder with a clear name
3. Put the code at the first layer of the task folder.
